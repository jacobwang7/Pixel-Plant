# Pixel Plant
Virtual Pixel Plant

Users get to take care of a virtual pixelated plant, water it, and see it grow into a different flower each time it blooms. 
The deciding factor for this plant to bloom is that you have to be consistent by watering it every day for 2 consecutive days.
The flower then blooms for 1 day and then reverts back to a little sapling waiting to bloom again.
