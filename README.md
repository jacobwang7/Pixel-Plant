Virtual Pixel Plant

You take care of this plant, water it, and it will grow a different flower each time it blooms. 
The deciding factor for this plant to bloom is that you have to be consistent by watering it every day for 4 consecutive days.
The flower then blooms for 3 days and then reverts back to a little sapling waiting to bloom again.
